# Basic information about architecture
The network takesÂ raw RGB video framesÂ of a pedestrian as an input and produces one-dimensional vector -Â **gait descriptor** that exposes as an identification vector. The identification vectors from gaits of each two different people should beÂ **linearly separable**. Whole network consists of two sub-networks connected in cascade â€“Â HumanPoseNN andÂ GaitNN.
**Spatial features**Â from the video frames are extracted according to the descriptors that involveÂ **pose of the pedestrian**. These descriptors are generated from the first sub-network -Â HumanPoseNNÂ defined inÂ human_pose_nnÂ module.Â HumanPoseNNÂ can be also used as a standalone network for regularÂ **2D pose estimation problem**Â from still images.
Responsibility of the second sub-network -Â GaitNNÂ defined inÂ gait_nnÂ module is the further processing of the generated spatial features into one-dimensionalÂ **pose descriptors**Â with the use of a residual convolutional network.Â Temporal featuresÂ are then extracted across theseÂ pose descriptorsÂ with the use of the multilayer recurrent cells -Â **LSTM**Â orÂ **GRU**. All temporal features are finally aggregated withÂ **Average temporal pooling**Â into one-dimensionalÂ **identification vector**Â with good discriminatory properties. As already mentioned in the text above, the human identification vectors are linearly separable with each other and can therefore be classified with e.g.Â **linear SVM**.
